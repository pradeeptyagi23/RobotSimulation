Existing Bugs : 

1. The SimulatedRobotWithCommunicationDelay class's set_position method creates a new thread but doesn't start it. The thread_update.start() line is missing.
2. The SimulatedRobotWithCommunicationDelay class's set_navigation_command method creates a new thread but doesn't start it. The thread_update.start() line is missing.
3. The SimulatedRobotWithCommunicationDelay class's set_navigation_command method uses the self._robot variable without locking it first, which could cause synchronization issues in a multithreaded environment.
4. The MissionController class's _poll_position method calls itself recursively without an exit condition, which could lead to a stack overflow error.
5. The MissionController class's _poll_position method doesn't use a lock when accessing the current_waypoint_idx variable, which could cause synchronization issues in a multithreaded environment.

Changelog for fixing issues and refactoring code for readability and maintainability.
To address these issues, you can add the following modifications to the code:

1. In the SimulatedRobotWithCommunicationDelay class's set_position method, add thread_update.start() after thread_update = Thread(target=update) to start the new thread.

2. In the SimulatedRobotWithCommunicationDelay class's set_navigation_command method, add thread_update.start() after thread_update = Thread(target=update) to start the new thread.
3. In the SimulatedRobotWithCommunicationDelay class's set_navigation_command method, add a lock before accessing the self._robot variable by defining lock = Lock() in the class constructor and using with lock: when accessing the self._robot variable.

4. In the MissionController class's _poll_position method, add a base case to the recursive call by checking if the mission has been completed or if the program has been terminated.

5. In the MissionController class's _poll_position method, add a lock before accessing the current_waypoint_idx variable by defining lock = Lock() in the class constructor and using with lock: when accessing the current_waypoint_idx variable.
